# Skin Lesion Prediction
### This is a capstone project for IBM Advanced Data Science Specialization

The process focuses on a structured and repeatable approach for data science projects, making collaboration and reuse of work faster and easier. The work is structured in five notebooks , one for each step in a data science project. 

#### * EDA - Initial Data Exploration
#### * ETL - Extract, Transform, Load
#### * Feature Creation/Extraction
#### * Model Definition/Training and Comparison
#### * Model Tuning, Evaluation and Use

### Use Case
Automated Pigmented Skin Lesion Diagnosis to augment diagnosis within a clinical setting or for use on mobile devices outside a clinical setting where access to low cost medical care may be limited. Pushing the model to mobile devices may potentially get this care into remote locations where internet service may be sparse or non-existent.
